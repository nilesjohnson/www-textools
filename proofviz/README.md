The file `skeleton.html` couples with the `wwwnotes2.cls` LaTeX class. After running `pdflatex` the files `\jobname-edges-xrf.csv` and `\jobname-vertices-xrf.csv` are created. The contents of the former are written by the `pfof` proof environment: it generates directed edges linking the proof of a "theorem-like" object to other objects. The contents of the second file are written by `\desclabel`. 

To visualize the logical structure of the proofs, the `skeleton.html` file uses the `D3.js` library with some `jQuery` magic to generate a force-directed graph. The nodes are the labelled objects, and the links are logical dependencies. To use the file, one needs a functioning webserver. After that, be sure to modify, in the javascript included in the body, the filenames of the `csv` files to point appropriately. Optionally one can also edit the title of the HTML file, and add some more CSS and content frills.
